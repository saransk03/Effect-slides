# Swiper.js Effect Slides with Dynamic Content

This project demonstrates an interactive effect slider using **Swiper.js**, where the content dynamically updates as you swipe through the cards. It combines smooth transitions, responsive design, and dynamic data handling to create an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Swiping**: Cards can be swiped left or right, with smooth, customizable transitions powered by Swiper.js.
- **Dynamic Content**: As each card is swiped, the content on the page (text, images, etc.) automatically updates, reflecting the active card.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Customizable Effects**: Easily configure Swiper.js settings for autoplay, slide effect, pagination, and more.
